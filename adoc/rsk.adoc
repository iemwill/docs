Currently (30.04.2020) there are less than `173 BTC` (more than `1.5 Million USD`) converted to R-BTC.

Checkout the holding of the bridge-contract and substract it from 21 Million:

== necessary environment

First of all you need to install electrum as described here https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/rbtc/conversion/

These are the faucets we will use:

- Bitcoin Testnet Faucet: https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/
- RSK Testnet Faucet: https://faucet.rsk.co/
- RIF Testnet Faucet: https://faucet.rifos.org/

Now you need to setup metamask with tRSK-configuration as described here:

- https://developers.rsk.co/tutorials/ethereum-devs/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/

or go with your account to switch networks and click on bottom add with following input:

== BTC <-> R-BTC "conversion"

We use here the Testnetwork of both systems following this guide:

- https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/rbtc/conversion/


To get the corresponding tR-BTC address from your tBTC address you need to use the following tool:

- https://github.com/rsksmart/utils

TIP: The repo threw a lot of errors caused by webpack. If you get errors too, try the following instead:

- https://github.com/iemwill/utils


And then you need to get in contact with the Team via your preferred channel and ask for a whitelisting on the bridge-contract.

IMPORTANT: Deliver the tBTC address you want to use from the electrum wallet.


Next step is calling the bridge with `getFederationAddress()` to get the BTC address you need to send your BTC.

First i tried the following contract:


```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract rBTCbridge {
    function getAddress () public returns(bool, bytes memory) {
        address aim = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000001000006;
        return aim.delegatecall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature(
                "getFederationAddress()"
            )
        );
    }
}
```

but since i got deploying problems with remix this time, i used https://www.myetherwallet.com/ connected via metamask and choosed the contract section to insert:

- Address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000001000006`
- ABI/JSON-Interface: `[{"name":"getFederationAddress","type":"function","constant":true,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}]}]`
-

TIP: This should return `2N1N5mdHWmRUfv49f7GnUeFfuyLcBQK7hj2`.


Transfer now 0.01 tBTC from the whitelisted tBTC address to the returned address. (as here TxID: `918fd47aac4ccdcccaf601bd9457487e2dc2781a1a6c7ce194d9703c993999c3`).

After around 15 confirmations you see the transferred tRBTC to the corresponding address (derived via @rsksmart/utils from the BTC private key. (In my case from `mra2W7HABdV3qxy5i3znrYiJrfm5tH2yUT`: https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/address/0x9dcea53b9efc7b451996f510adb9e8f54eb4243a)

NOTE: Until 29th of April 2020 the explorer doesn't show internal transactions like etherscan.io we just see the balance is there and no incoming transaction.


=== tR-BTC to BTC

Just send an amount (min. `0.005`) to the bridge (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000001000006`) and wait...

This was mine https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/0xbd57921340808a94ba336a0b9cdd307e9aa8750fba48a70630a45dd570212b0f[0xbd57921340808a94ba336a0b9cdd307e9aa8750fba48a70630a45dd570212b0f] and after 200 Blocks there was no tBTC at `mra2W7HABdV3qxy5i3znrYiJrfm5tH2yUT`.
